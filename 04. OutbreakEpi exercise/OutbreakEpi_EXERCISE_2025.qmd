# Background 1
The second largest ever Ebola virus disease outbreak occurred in 2018/19 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  For your reference, you can find the Situation Reports (SitRep) for the outbreak on the WHO website. 

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/situation-reports

Since the start of the outbreak on 30 Apr 2018 until the end of September, there were 3,205 cases and 2,142 deaths were reported.  Here is the Epi curve to the end of Sept 2018.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("drc_ebola_v2.png", dpi=10)
```

## Question 1

What would have been the best time to intervene in this outbreak and why? 

**ANSWER BELOW**  


# Background 2

We'll now focus on the first few weeks of the outbreak. All the information you need for this exercise is contained below and in the data files in the links.

```{r, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
drc_ebola <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blopman/epi569/master/DRC_Ebola_CFR.csv") # Read in the data
```

Here are the cases (Grey Bars) and deaths based on week of death (Blue Bars) and death based on week of case's onset (Black line) from the first few weeks of the outbreak

```{r, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(drc_ebola, aes(x = Week)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = Cases), fill = "grey") + 
  geom_col(aes(y = Deaths._in_week), fill = "steelblue") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = Deaths._from_onset_in_week), color = "black",  size = 1)
```

We can calculate and plot the crude CFR (Blue) and adjusted CFR (Black) as follows

```{r, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
drc_ebola %>% 
  mutate(cum_cases = cumsum(Cases)) %>% 
  mutate(cum_crude_deaths = cumsum(Deaths._in_week)) %>% 
  mutate(cum_adjusted_deaths = cumsum(Deaths._from_onset_in_week)) %>% 
  mutate(crude_cfr = cum_crude_deaths/cum_cases) %>% 
  mutate(adjusted_cfr = cum_adjusted_deaths/cum_cases) -> drc_ebola

ggplot(drc_ebola, aes(x = Week)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = crude_cfr), color = "steelblue", size = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = adjusted_cfr), color = "black", size = 1) + 
  ylab("Case fatality")
```


## Question 2

a.    Explain the differences between the crude CFR and the adjusted CFR that is based on date of onset of the deceased case.

**ANSWER BELOW** 

b.    Why is the crude CFR lower than the adjusted CFR?

**ANSWER BELOW**

c.    Why does the adjusted CFR appear to decline in the last few weeks? 

**ANSWER BELOW**

**Note:** *If we had line-lists of cases (which we do not here), we could also calculate the CFRs based on known outcomes (survived or died).*


# Background 3

Now, lets turn to calculating the $R_0$ from the initial growth rate from the beginning of the outbreak. First, import the case counts from the first few weeks of the outbreak.

```{r, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
r0_ebola <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blopman/epi569/master/DRC_Ebola_week.csv")
```

```{r, include = TRUE, echo = T, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(r0_ebola, aes(onset_week, cases)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  ggtitle("Plot of cases")
```

```{r, include = TRUE, echo = T, warning=FALSE}
r0_ebola %>% 
  mutate(log_cases = log(cases)) -> r0_ebola

ggplot(r0_ebola, aes(onset_week, log_cases)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  ggtitle("Plot of log cases")
```


## Question 3

a.    In order to calculate the basic reproductive number based on initial growth of the epidemic, which time interval would you use?

**ANSWER BELOW**  

b.    Why did you select this time?

**ANSWER BELOW**

Add those weeks by changing R code below:

```{r}
start_week <- 0 #change this number
end_week <- 30 #change this number
```


## Question 4

What is your calculation for the basic reproductive number?

**ANSWER BELOW**
 
```{r, include = TRUE, echo = T, message=FALSE}
r0_ebola %>% 
  filter(onset_week>=start_week, onset_week <= end_week) %>% 
  splitstackshape::expandRows("cases", drop = FALSE) %>% 
  select(onset_week) %>% 
  pull(onset_week) -> linelist
i <- incidence(linelist)

mu <- 3 # mean in weeks                     #Generation time of ebola is about 21 days or 3 weeks
sigma <- 3 # standard deviation in weeks

res <- get_R(i, si_mean = mu, si_sd = sigma)
R_val <- sample_R(res, 1000)
mean(R_val)

#This plot shows the likelihood distribution of the R estimate
plot(res) 

```


## Question 5

Next, <u>test at least 2 different scenarios</u> to see how your estimate of $R_0$ changes when selecting different start/end weeks for exponential growth. Potential scenarios to consider might include:

-   What happens if you include time before or after when exponential growth is occurring?
-   What happens if you include periods of decreasing case counts? 

Summarize your findings in the table shell below, rounding $R_0$ to 2 decimal places (n.nn). Briefly describe (~2-3 sentences) how your choice of time period affects the $R_0$ estimate.

```{r, message=FALSE}
##Scenario 1
# Choose start/end week. Change values of scen1_start and scen1_end

scen1_start <- 0 #XX
scen1_end <-  30 #YY

# Estimate Ro
r0_ebola %>% 
  filter(onset_week>=scen1_start, onset_week <= scen1_end) %>% 
  splitstackshape::expandRows("cases", drop = FALSE) %>% 
  select(onset_week) %>% 
  pull(onset_week) -> linelist
i <- incidence(linelist)

mu <- 3 # mean in weeks                     #Generation time of ebola is about 21 days or 3 weeks
sigma <- 3 # standard deviation in weeks

res <- get_R(i, si_mean = mu, si_sd = sigma)
scen1_Ro <- sample_R(res, 1000)
mean(scen1_Ro)

```

```{r, message=FALSE}
##Scenario 2
# Choose different start/end week. Change values of scen2_start and scen2_end
scen2_start <- 0 #WW
scen2_end <- 30 #ZZ

# Estimate Ro
r0_ebola %>% 
  filter(onset_week>=scen2_start, onset_week <= scen2_end) %>% 
  splitstackshape::expandRows("cases", drop = FALSE) %>% 
  select(onset_week) %>% 
  pull(onset_week) -> linelist
i <- incidence(linelist)

mu <- 3 # mean in weeks                     #Generation time of ebola is about 21 days or 3 weeks
sigma <- 3 # standard deviation in weeks

res <- get_R(i, si_mean = mu, si_sd = sigma)
scen2_Ro <- sample_R(res, 1000)
mean(scen2_Ro)


```

```{r, message=FALSE}
##Scenario 3 (OPTIONAL)
# Choose different start/end week. Change values of scen3_start and scen3_end
scen3_start <- 0 #MM
scen3_end <- 30 #NN

# Estimate Ro
r0_ebola %>% 
  filter(onset_week>=scen3_start, onset_week <= scen3_end) %>% 
  splitstackshape::expandRows("cases", drop = FALSE) %>% 
  select(onset_week) %>% 
  pull(onset_week) -> linelist
i <- incidence(linelist)

mu <- 3 # mean in weeks                     #Generation time of ebola is about 21 days or 3 weeks
sigma <- 3 # standard deviation in weeks

res <- get_R(i, si_mean = mu, si_sd = sigma)
scen3_Ro <- sample_R(res, 1000)
mean(scen3_Ro)
```
